# stupid React Context experiments
This experiment uses React 16.6, TypeScript 3+, and the new Context API.  The purpose of this experiment is to use the new
Context API to manage state changes without Redux or "prop drilling".

This is a barebones experiment that includes an HTTP (GET) request to display data without using Axios or other ajax library.
